* timings: 
  * from the first hour till the seventh day, the publisher can close the question if a suitable answer has been given (what if there are no suitable answers? or no answers at all?)
  * once the deadline has passed, the publisher receives a notification to choose a suitable answer. (what if he does not choose a suitable answer? will it be auto-closed?)

* check that only the question's publisher can pick the suitable answer, close the question, etc.
* add some common sense links to pages
* try to put the rendering of the page/action in oracle/questions/:id/answers into helpers
* when no answers/questions exist, put an explanation there, not just a blank list
* include the tog_oracle stylesheet on tog_oracle pages
* i18n
* get tog_oracle to be testable (unit tests have never been run because of rails gem 2.3 clash!)


DONE
====

* remove radio buttons to select suitable answer once the question is closed
